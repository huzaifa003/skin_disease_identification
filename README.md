## Datasets
-- The dataset currently consists of csv files uploaded in this github due to 100 files limitation, it's hard to upload 17k images from them. 
-- This is currently just of flitz17k on which we are experimenting, we'll upload the DDI as soon as we get on it but for MVP this is what we are working on!
-- The images dataset is currently uploaded to Kaggle because it makes it easier to load and use on kaggle notebooks than uploading all that in drive. as the extractions were giving inconsistent reults. P.S the GPU of Kaggle is bigger.


## Code
-- This has the segmentation notebooks and preprecessing .py files that we created for downloading, bit of cleaning and analysis.
-- The code for object detection is currently going in Kaggle Notebooks as it's more easier to work there with large datasets.
-- The resulting notebooks will be uploaded here with the intended outputs inside of it.

## App
-- This is basically Mobile app we been working on as a prototype, it's basically frontend we are doing as semester project.
-- it's not the primary focus, but we are prototyping as per the code to avoid doing a whole redo of app.
